<p>Repo purpose: Submission for INIT selection tasks (Task 1 — Python/Data Challenge & Task 2 — Research Evaluation).</p>
<p>Note: I have completed Task 2 (Research Evaluation) and am submitting that now. I am learning the skills required for Task 1 and will add the notebook/script for it later.</p>

<p>Short summary of task 2</p>
I read and summarized the AlexNet paper by Krizhevsky et al. (NIPS 2012). The summary explains the model architecture, the practical choices (ReLU, dropout, data augmentation, GPU training) and why it was important to computer vision. The reflection discusses a limitation (large compute/data requirement) and a modern improvement direction (self-supervised learning / lightweight architectures).

Notes for the interviewers

I focused on Task 2 because I wanted to submit high-quality analysis of the paper.

I am actively learning Python, pandas, and practical data-science workflows and plan to complete Task 1 soon.

During the interview I’m happy to discuss:

-My summary and reflection on the AlexNet paper.

-My learning plan and timelines for building the technical skills needed for Task 1.

-Any small demo or conceptual questions about CNNs, ReLU, dropout, data augmentation, and overfitting.
